# Blackjack
An applet game where you can bet and play Blackjack.

# How to run it?
All the assets have to be in the same folder, including .java and .html. If you are an Eclipse user, see the instruction here: https://help.eclipse.org/2019-12/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.jdt.doc.user%2Ftasks%2Ftask-launching_java_applet.htm

Or you can use others IDE such as JCreator to directly launch the program.
